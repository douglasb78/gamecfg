## NEW: HUD Installer / Customizer
CriticalFlaw and Revan are currently developing **TF2HUD.Editor**, which will allow you to install and customize budhud (and other huds) quickly and easily. 

Click [here](https://github.com/CriticalFlaw/TF2HUD.Editor/releases) to see the latest release, and feel free to join CriticalFlaw's Discord [here](https://discord.gg/hTdtK9vBhE) if you'd like to make suggestions!

### Notes Regarding budhud Customization
- In other huds, a majority of the files you edit are located in the root hud directory under `resource` and `scripts`. In budhud, this only applies to scheme and animation files. A majority of the files you'll want to edit will be located within the `..\budhud\_budhud\` directory.
- Because of the structure of the HUD, I would not advise people to use it as a base for their own custom HUDs. Though it is certainly possible, it requires a fairly deep understanding of hud editing and #base to be properly executed upon.
